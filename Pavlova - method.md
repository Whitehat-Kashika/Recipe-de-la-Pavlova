###     üç® **For Meringue Shell** üç® 

1. *Heat the oven to 275 F/140 C and place the low rack in the middle of the oven.*

2. *Line a baking tray with foil and draw a 7-inch circle on the foil with the blunt edge of a knife without tearing the foil. Set it aside to use later.* 

3. *In a medium-sized bowl, beat the egg whites with a clean electric mixer on medium speed. Beat until the whites form soft peaks (which are actually like stiff meringue peaks but softer).*

4. *Sprinkle the sugar gently into the egg whites, 1 teaspoon at a time, beating continuously until the whites form stiff glossy peaks (harder and tougher than the soft peaks).*

5. *Sprinkle the cornstarch and vinegar on the meringue and fold in gently with a plastic spatula (not the electric mixer, for that may overwhip it).*

6. *Add the quantity of vanilla in and gently fold again.*

7. *Now spread the meringue in the circle on the foil to make a circular base. Make sure the edges of the meringue are slightly higher than the center so you have a very slight hollow in the middle.*

8. *Bake the meringue for about **1 hour and 15 minutes** or until it goes a very pale, pinkish eggshell color.*

9. *Turn the oven off and leave the door slightly open to let the meringue cool down totally. As the meringue cools, it will get cracks slightly.*

10.  *Just before serving, take the meringue out of the oven and remove it from the foil and place on a plate.*

    ### üç® **For the Whipped Cream and Garnish** üç® 

11. *Whip the cream with the vanilla and icing sugar until it forms soft peaks and set it just aside.*

12. *Prepare the fruit by washing and slicing and toss fruits that get brown in lemon juice.*

13. *Spread the cream over the top of the cooled meringue with a spatula (be gentle!).*

14. *Arrange the fruit on top and serve immediately and eat (don‚Äôt forget to clean the mess in your kitchen).*
